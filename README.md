About source project:

 This application is made with Tasker:
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
and with Tasker app factory:
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory ).
To install and run 'SURM' you will not need any of this
application. However, if you want to ‘view’ or ‘modify’ source file you
'will need' Tasker application and if you want to 'export your own
modification' then you 'will need both' Tasker and its extension app
Tasker app factory

You can find more detailed info about how SURM works in the developer Guide pdf file.
By the way I know SURM's maximum features aren't as useful in our day-to-day’s task. This is my little effort. 
With this project I have tried to explain how the classic 'AI' Virtual Assistance program works.
And I've tried to show that even with mobile platforms (especially
using Tasker), complex applications can be programmed.
